## Prefabs2Blueprints Version 0.1

This Python script converts Space Engineers prefabs to Blueprints.

To use P2B, you need [Python 3][0].

### Requirements

To use the script, you need to either download and install [Git][1] and then [clone the repository][2], or [download the code directly][3].

If you're confused, [just download and install Python][0] and [download the code][3].

### Using the code

1. Browse to `C:/Users/<YourName>/AppData/Roaming/SpaceEngineers/Blueprints/local`.
2. Create a new folder in there. Name it however you like.
3. Put in that folder the `.sbc` prefab file you want to convert.
4. Browse where you downloaded the code, and open `config.py` with any text editor.
5. Edit `NAME` to the name of the folder you created in step 2.
6. You may edit any other setting to your liking.

When you're done editing your settings, save `config.py` and double-click on `converter.py`.
Wait a bit and it should complete without problem.
